STA 525 final project

Identify covariates
1. smoking (tobacco_smoking_history)
2. age (grouped) (age_at_initial_pathologic_diagnosis)
3. pathologic stage (pathologic_stage)
4. cancer type (histological_type)
5. maybe gender
Find the code book for these covariates
Attach them to the master dataset
Do Wilcoxon Rank Sum scan across all features for EACH covariate in RNA-seq
Do some test scan across all features for ALL covariate in RNA-seq
Select some sig. genes map to met data
Do some test to see if the results agree with RNA-seq
Extra: see SummaryExperiment in TCGAbiolink analysis
